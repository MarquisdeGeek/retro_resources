## Jet Set Willy

The first (any maybe only!?!?!) data set I'll do is for the classic, Jet Set Willy.

The project contains images of every level, along with a whole-game map, and two
digraphs showing how the rooms fit together. I've also included some links and the
JavaScript necessary to generate the dot files.
